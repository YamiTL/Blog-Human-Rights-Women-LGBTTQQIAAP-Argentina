# Blog-Human-Rights-Women-LGBTTQQIAAP-Argentina
A modest blog, done with much love in HTML, Sass CSS and Javascript. This blog showcases the relentless struggle women and the LGBTTQQIAAP community went through (and are still going through) to receive universal Human Rights in Argentina, from 1950 to 2022.
Thank you for reading!
